# Text2SQL-OpenAI

This project leverages LangChain, SQLAlchemy, and OpenAI's API to create a conversational AI system that allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive SQL query results from a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model to generate SQL queries based on user input and retrieves data from the specified database.

## Features

- Natural language to SQL query conversion.
- Interactive conversation history to maintain context.
- Retrieves and displays results from a PostgreSQL database.
- Error handling for invalid queries.
